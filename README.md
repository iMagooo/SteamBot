This modified SteamBot project aims to help those who farm TF2 items across many different Steam accounts by providing an easy to use item collection system.

**SteamBot** is a bot written in C# for the purpose of interacting with Steam Chat and Steam Trade.  As of right now, about 8 contributors have all added to the bot.  The bot is publicly available under the MIT License. Check out [LICENSE] for more details.

There are several things you must do in order to get SteamBot working:

1. Download the source.
2. Compile the source code.
3. Configure the bots (username, password, etc.). You must specify at least 1 Collecting bot! (See wiki for more details)
4. *Optionally*, customize the behaviour by changing the source code.

## Getting the Source

Retrieving the source code should be done by following the [installation guide] on the wiki. The install guide covers the instructions needed to obtain the source code as well as the instructions for compiling the code.

## Configuring the Bot

See the [configuration guide] on the wiki. This guide covers configuring a basic bot as well as creating a custom user handler.

## Bot Administration

While running the bots you may find it necessary to do some basic operations like shutting down and restarting a bot. The console will take some commands to allow you to do some this. See the [usage guide] for more information.
