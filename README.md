This modified SteamBot project aims to help those who farm TF2 items across many different Steam accounts by providing an easy to use item collection system. In order for the system to work as intended you should use Steam accounts that are able to use trade offers without email confirmation. I have written the majority of the code added to make this modification to SteamBot (code reused is acknowledged within the code, IIRC I only reused one function), but I would like to shoutout to the original creators of SteamBot, [Jessecar96] and [geel9], for their tremendous work on the SteamBot project.

**SteamBot** is a bot written in C# for the purpose of interacting with Steam Chat and Steam Trade.  As of right now, about 8 contributors have all added to the [original project].  The bot is publicly available under the MIT License. Check out [LICENSE] for more details.

There are several things you must do in order to get SteamBot working:

1. Download the source.
2. Compile the source code.
3. Configure the bots (username, password, etc.). You must specify at least 1 Collecting bot! (See wiki for more details)
4. *Optionally*, customize the behaviour by changing the source code.

## Getting the Source

Retrieving the source code should be done by following the [installation guide] on the wiki. The install guide covers the instructions needed to obtain the source code as well as the instructions for compiling the code.

## Configuring the Bot

See the [configuration guide] on the wiki. This guide covers configuring a basic bot as well as creating a custom user handler.

## Changes from original SteamBot

You may notice some changes from the original SteamBot framework. The most notable change being the removal of using separate processes for each running bot. I made this decision to simplify Bot-to-BotManager communication. Due to the lack of modularity in the original SteamBot framework I have had to chop and change the code, rather than building upon it.
If you already use SteamBot and wish to utilise this project be sure to copy across /Bin/Debug/sentryfiles/ OR /Bin/Release/sentryfiles/ to ensure you do not receive a no-trade period on Steam for this system.
